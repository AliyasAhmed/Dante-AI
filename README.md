Your very own desktop helper is this.
All windows can be minimised simultaneously by just stating "minimise."
Just saying "search YouTube." will allow us to play any video on YouTube without even having to access the website.
Saying "search Google." allows us to look up anything on the internet as well.
With this helper, we can shut down every website we launched.
By saying these words, we can find out the time, the weather, and the news.
We can pause, take a screenshot, and play YouTube videos.
